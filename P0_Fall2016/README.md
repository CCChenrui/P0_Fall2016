Python tutorial project for CPSC 471/510 Fall 2016

See http://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html for basic description
(Note: We will use gitlab instead of downloading the zip files!)

Fork this project, clone your fork into your user space, make changes as needed, commit, and push to your fork.

For grading, I will have a script that clones your fork (master branch), and runs the auto grader script.
